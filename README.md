# Wallflower

Wallflower is a browser-driver test harness that is designed to run in the background of your host machine.

## Goals

1.  No Focus
    -   Should be able to run in the background on your local machine
1.  Simple API
    -   Should be able to run with `npm` scripts
    -   Should be able to integrate with other test runners (e.g., Mocha, Jest, etc.)
